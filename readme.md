# 1.5x Speed Analog Clock

It is said that using a clock that runs faster than usual can help you get more work done.

This analog clock is designed to run at 1.5x real time to enhance your focus and time management. For example, while a typical second hand takes 30 seconds to make a half turn, on this clock, it completes a half turn in just 20 seconds.
